### About Me:

-   I love birds and have been birding since I was nine years old (Trisha's Comment: That is so cool! I've never really been a skilled birder but I downloaded EBird recently and have started getting into it!)

-   My favorite season is winter because of downhill skiing (Trisha's Comment: It is my biggest regret that we live so close to Greek Peak yet I haven't ever skied before.)

-   I want to live in Colorado someday and rock climb in the mountains (Trisha's Comment: I'm from TX, so not too far from Colorado! Come visit sometime!)
