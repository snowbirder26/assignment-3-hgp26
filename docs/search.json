I’ve never really been a skilled birder but I downloaded EBird recently and have started getting into it!)\nMy favorite season is winter because of downhill skiing (Trisha’s Comment: It is my biggest regret that we live so close to Greek Peak yet I haven’t ever skied before.)\nI want to live in Colorado someday and rock climb in the mountains (Trisha’s Comment: I’m from TX, so not too far from Colorado! Come visit sometime!)"
